# Detection and tracking of moving objects in public environments on the ZYNQ platform (real-time processing)
In some applications, there is a need for very high speed processing, high security, low consumption, small volume and the ability to update the device. There are many options ahead, but none of them can be completely ZYNQ.
Various platforms with access and purchase capabilities have been reviewed, which included various types of processors with variations in programming. Next, in the fourth chapter, the desired algorithm was introduced and implemented first in MATLAB software and then using the OpenCV library. And finally, by coding in HLS software, the desired core was made and using Vivado and SDK software, the desired process was transferred to the board.
